		 <P> ATP is the energy of the cells; It stands for Adenine Triphosphate. It's important for cell functions such as active transport, muslce contraction and cell signaling. As indicated by it's name, it's made of adenine, ribose and three phosphates. </p>
		 
		 
		 <P> Animal cells obtain energy (ATP) through respiration, a process that is the opposite of photosynthesis. Products from photosynthesis such as oxygena and glucose become the 
           reactants for respiration. The three steps are: 1. Glycolysis 2. Krebs Cycle 3. Electron Transport Chain 
           
           The result is 38 ATP produced, water and carbon dioxide, which we exhale </P>
