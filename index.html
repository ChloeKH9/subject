         <P> Cells are the basic units of all living thingfs. They contain many organelles that all have specific functions, for example ribosomes produce proteins.
             Other organelles include the nucelus, mitochondria, Rough ER, smooth ER and the golgi body.

          Plants undergo an important process called photosynthesis which takes place in the chloroplasts. The formula for photosynthesis is 6CO2 + 6H20 + light =
          C601206 +602. The two steps that photosynthesis has are 
            1. Light Dependent Reactions
            2. Calvin Cycle
