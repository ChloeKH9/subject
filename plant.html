         <P> Plants undergo an important process called photosynthesis which takes place in the chloroplasts. The formula for photosynthesis is 6CO2 + 6H20 + light =
          C601206 +602. The two steps that photosynthesis has are Light Dependent Reactions and the Calvin Cycle, which is referred to as light independent. The purpose of photosynthesis is to produce sugar for the plant.  </P>
