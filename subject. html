      <h2> The CellðŸ§« </h2>                  
         <P> Cells are the basic units of all living thingfs. They contain many organelles that all have specific functions, for example ribosomes produce proteins.
             Other organelles include the nucelus, mitochondria, Rough ER, smooth ER and the golgi body.   </P>

         <P> Plants undergo an important process called photosynthesis which takes place in the chloroplasts. The formula for photosynthesis is 6CO2 + 6H20 + light =
          C601206 +602. The two steps that photosynthesis has are 
            1. Light Dependent Reactions
            2. Calvin Cycle  </P>

      <h2> Energyâš¡ </h2>
         <P> Animal cells obtain energy (ATP) through respiration, a process that is the opposite of photosynthesis. Products from photosynthesis such as oxygena and glucose become the 
           reactants for respiration. The three steps are: 1. Glycolysis 2. Krebs Cycle 3. Electron Transport Chain 
           
           The result is 38 ATP produced, water and carbon dioxide, which we exhale

      <h2> DNA ðŸ§¬</h2>     <p> <img src = "https://s3.amazonaws.com/lowres.cartoonstock.com/science-dna-geneticists-therapists-shrinks-genetics-bven460_low.jpg" atl = "Bio Comic" > </p>
           <p> The DNA structure is crucial to carry out it's functions. It's shape is a double helix with bacbones made of sugar phosphate and rungs( like a twisted ladder) of nucelotides. 
              DNA needs to replicate and undergo transcription. REplication produces the same copy of the DNA but transcription produces an RNA copy of the DNA sequence. RNA is different from DNA for many reasons, 
             one being the differences in bases. RNA is then sued to produce proteins during translation. </P>
