           <p> The DNA structure is crucial to carry out it's functions. It's shape is a double helix with bacbones made of sugar phosphate and rungs( like a twisted ladder) of nucelotides. The nucleotides are adenine, thymine, cytosine and guanine. Adenine binds to thymine while cytosine bonds to guanine</p>
              
			 <P>DNA needs to replicate, a process that produces the same copy of the DNA. The strands are unwound by helicase and nucleotides are added to the two strands by DNA polymerase. It's important to note that polymerase only moves in a 5' to 3' direction meaning that 1 strand is synthesized in Okazaki fragments </p>
			 <P> DNA needs to undergo transciption and translation in order to produce proteins for the body. Transcription makes an RNA copy of the DNA sequence. RNA is different from DNA for many reasons, 
             one being the differences in bases. The three steps of both processes are initiation, elongation and termination.  RNA is then used to produce proteins during translation. A codon, which is a set of 3 bases, will code for a specific protein. </P>
