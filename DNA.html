           <p> The DNA structure is crucial to carry out it's functions. It's shape is a double helix with bacbones made of sugar phosphate and rungs( like a twisted ladder) of nucelotides. 
              DNA needs to replicate and undergo transcription. REplication produces the same copy of the DNA but transcription produces an RNA copy of the DNA sequence. RNA is different from DNA for many reasons, 
             one being the differences in bases. RNA is then sued to produce proteins during translation. </P>
